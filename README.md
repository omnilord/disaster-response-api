# Disaster Resources API

This API application is distilled from the efforts to mitigate resource management activities during Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Florence by Sketch City and Code for America.  The goal of this API project is to create an easily deployable, interoperable OpenAPI for resource information management during a disaster and make it easily deployable and accessible to the people on the ground who need fast access to resources and a map to find how to get there.

This application comes with a management UI and an OpenAPI Endpoint for use by third-party tools to index and map the resources in areas affected by disaster.
